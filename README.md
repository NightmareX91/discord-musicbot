# discord-musicbot
A music bot for Discord.

# How do I use it?
You need to run `npm install` after cloning it, and you need to configure `auth.json` and `server.json`.

# This works on only one server at a time?
Yep. Discord has recently added a bot tag that allows bot accounts to join multiple voice servers, but I haven't looked into setting that up.
